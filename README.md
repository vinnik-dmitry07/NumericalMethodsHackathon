1. The sought functions *f* are sums of several (from 1 to 5) elementary functions with some integer positive coefficients. The guess-koeffs directory lists tables of values between 0.5 and 3.
    * Using the OLS and the system of normal equations, restore the appearance of the function *f* for each data set.
    * Display data set and function graph
    * An example of a possible function is: f(x) = c1 * x + c2 * cos(x)
    * Hint: In some functions, a trigonometric function may occur with an intrinsic integer coefficient, such as cos (3 * x). You can guess this by looking at the location of the points.
